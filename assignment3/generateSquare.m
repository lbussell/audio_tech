% [10] Write a function [t,x] = generateSquare(amplitude, frequencyInHz, 
% lengthInS, phaseInRadians) that generates a square wave with these
% parameters and writes the output vector into x while t is a vector 
% containing the time in seconds. Generate the waveform with 65536 samples 
% per second.
t = null;
x = null;
