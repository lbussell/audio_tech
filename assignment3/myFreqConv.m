function y = myFreqConv(x,h)
% 5.b [20] Implement a matlab function myFreqConv.m that computes time domain
% convolution via multiplication in the frequency domain. 
% In this part, you may compute the FFT of each of the signal entirely,
% multiply them in frequency domain, and compute the inverse FFT to get 
% your result. Your function interface should be y = myFreqConv(x, h), 
% in which x and h are the signal and impulse response respectively. 
% Zeropad both signal and IR so that the length of the FFT is the power of
% 2 greater than length(x) + length(h) - 1.
y = null;
