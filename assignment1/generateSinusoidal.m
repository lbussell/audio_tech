function [t,x] = generateSinusoidal(amplitude, frequencyInHz, lengthInS)

% Generate a sinusoidal according to the parameters,
% given that you assume 44100 data points per second (sample rate).

% The output is the time t in seconds
% and the generated signal as vectors of the same length.

t = null;
x = null;

% Plot the result of the function x over t for
% amplitude=0.5, frequencyInHz=2,lengthInS=1
